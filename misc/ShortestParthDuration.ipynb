    "Sure! Here’s a **step-by-step explanation** of how **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Initialization**\n",
    "- Choose a **starting node** (where you begin your journey).\n",
    "- Set the **cost to reach the start node to `0`**.\n",
    "- Set the cost to reach all other nodes to **infinity (`∞`)** (since we haven’t calculated their shortest paths yet).\n",
    "- Create a **priority queue** (or a min heap) to store nodes **sorted by their current shortest known distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Process the Start Node**\n",
    "- Start with the **node having the smallest known distance** (initially the start node).\n",
    "- Mark it as **visited**—it won’t be revisited because we have finalized its shortest path.\n",
    "- Look at all **neighboring nodes** connected to this node and calculate the cost to reach them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Update Neighboring Nodes**\n",
    "- For each **neighbor** of the current node:\n",
    "  - **Compute the new potential shortest distance**:  \n",
    "    `distance to current node + edge cost to neighbor`\n",
    "  - If the new calculated distance is **shorter than the previously known distance**, update it.\n",
    "  - Store which node led to this shortest distance (for reconstructing the path later).\n",
    "  - Add this neighbor to the **priority queue** for future processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Select the Next Node**\n",
    "- Remove the **node with the smallest known distance** from the priority queue.\n",
    "- Repeat **steps 2 & 3** for this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Stop When Target Node is Processed**\n",
    "- If we reach the **target destination**, stop processing further nodes.\n",
    "- Otherwise, continue selecting the next smallest distance node and repeating the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Reconstruct the Shortest Path**\n",
    "- **Trace back** from the target node using stored previous nodes to reconstruct the optimal path.\n",
    "- The result is the **shortest route** from the start node to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Properties of Dijkstra’s Algorithm**\n",
    "✔ **Greedy Choice** – Always picks the node with the smallest known distance first.  \n",
    "✔ **No Cycles / Infinite Loops** – Ensures that nodes are **not revisited** once their shortest path is finalized.  \n",
    "✔ **Guarantees Optimality** – Works best with **non-negative** edge weights, ensuring **always the shortest path**.  \n",
